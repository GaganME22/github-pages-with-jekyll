See, its a small word but has very big importance
in our life.
The first thing that comes in my mind on listening
the word see is eyes.
but we don't only see with our eyes only
think of blind people 
you cannot say that they don't see.
They just see differenty.
They see things buy touch, know them by smell and voice.
So everyone see world in their own ways not with their own eyes.

Thankyou.
